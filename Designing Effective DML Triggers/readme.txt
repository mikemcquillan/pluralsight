Welcome to the Designing Effective DML Triggers for SQL Server course code!

SETTING UP THE DATABASE

1. Open up the DatabaseScripts folder.
2. Open up the 000_Sqlcmd_Script.sql code.
3. On the first line:

   :setvar path "C:\code\effective-dml-triggers\DatabaseScripts\"
   
   Change the path C:\code\effective-dml-triggers\DatabaseScripts\ to the path where you have saved the files.
   Ensure you keep the trailing backslash, e.g. if you have saved the files to c:\triggercode, change the path to:
   
   C:\triggercode\
   
4. Once the changes are saved, open the file in SSMS.
5. Go to the Query menu and click SQLCMD mode.
6. Execute the script, the StockSystem database will be created

The rest of the code can be followed in conjunction with the course. Enjoy yourself and happy learning!
