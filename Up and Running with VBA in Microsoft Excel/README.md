Up and Running with VBA in Microsoft Excel README

Pre-requisites:

- Windows or Mac computer running a fairly recent version of Microsoft Excel

Copy the two workbooks in the "Clean Demo Files" folder to your computer.

Module 1 uses the CustomerData.xlsx file.
Module 2 uses the StockData.xlsx file.

If you're following along using a corporate machine, you may need to speak to your IT department to enable macro execution.

There are some exercises at the end of the course. Try these yourself!
However, if you just want to see how they could be completed, look at this file in the Module2 folder:

2.9 StockData - Exercise Answers.xlsm

Enjoy your VBA, thanks for reading!
